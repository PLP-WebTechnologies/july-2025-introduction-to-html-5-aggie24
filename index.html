             <b>Ironically</b>,
             <i> this fixation on the positive—on what’s better, what’s
                superior—only serves to remind us over and over again of what we are not,
                of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be.</i>
             <u> After all, no truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that
             <em>she’s happy.</em>
             <strong>She just is.</strong><br>
             <hr>
             There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A
             confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich
             woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich.
